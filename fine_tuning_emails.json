This means\nthe student must submit the waiver form and submit proof of the required\nhealth insurance coverage. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to request a\nwaiver before the 10th class day of each semester. It is good to note that if\nthe proof of insurance does not include medical evacuation and repatriation\ncoverages, then the student will automatically be enrolled in this.

We really appreciate your interest in joining Johnson & Johnson. As\nyou go through the process, we take the time to review your professional\nbackground and experience and make sure that they align with what\u2019s needed for\nthe role. Though your achievements are impressive, they didn\u2019t exactly line up\nwith what we\u2019re looking for in this particular job. We want you to know that\nthere are three main reasons as to why it might not have worked out and some\nhave nothing to do with you:\n\n  1. Timing: sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work out for the role you want and what we have available. It doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t qualified or capable of handling the role.\n  2. Shift in priorities: we might have decided to go in a different direction based on changing business needs.\n  3. There might have been a more qualified candidate for the role.\n\nWe understand that being rejected is always disappointing no matter how far\nalong you\u2019ve made it in the process. But, don\u2019t let it hold you back. Your\nrelationship with Johnson & Johnson doesn\u2019t end here and there are some things\nyou can do to open yourself up to other possibilities:\n\n  1. Refer back to Shine to take advantage of valuable content in articles and videos that will help you bounce back. Also, get practical guidance and general career advice related to our hiring experience and what to do after you submit an application\u2014all information you can use in the future, whether at Johnson & Johnson or beyond. Simply log in with your Careers website credentials.\n  2. Continue to search and apply for other job openings by visiting our Careers Website. We\u2019re constantly adding new positions that may be a better fit for you.\n\nIf you did not opt in during the application process and you would like\nJohnson & Johnson to keep your application data on file with the purpose of\nidentifying and sending you relevant information about future career\nopportunities that match your skills and preferences, please go here and\nprovide your consent.  \nWe wish you the best of luck as you continue your search and we hope that this\nwon\u2019t be the last time we cross paths.  \n  \nBest,  \n| Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition Team  \n---  \n  \n  \n|  \n---  \n**Please note:** Our** ** Privacy Policy & Legal Notice  \n**Please, do not reply to this message as this mailbox is unmonitored.**  \n  \n**Confidentiality Notice:** This e-mail transmission may contain confidential\nor legally privileged information that is intended only for the individual or\nentity named in the e-mail address.

It is important to understand that\nConfirming Attendance essentially confirms your commitment to attending the\nFall 2023 semester and paying for your course(s). If a student does not\nConfirm Attendance, they may be automatically dropped from their courses by UT\nsystem. If a student is dropped from their course(s) and wants to be added\nback, they would incur a late registration fee (anywhere from $50 to $200 -\namounts are dictated by the Registrar). You may confirm attendance on the My\nTuition Bill page. Note that our department is part of the College of Natural\nSciences, so do not be alarmed if you see Natural Sciences listed there.\nPlease note that if you have recently registered for courses, it may take at\nleast 24 hours for your What I Owe page, edX and My Tuition Bill page (student\nfees to be $0.00) to accurately reflect your registration. POINTS OF CONTACT\nThroughout the semester you may need assistance. Here is a list to guide you:\nAccounting Inquiries: MSDSgradcoordinator@utexas.edu Program Inquiries:\nMSDSgradcoordinator@utexas.edu Class or content related issues: contact your\nclass TA (listed in syllabi) Technical issues with edX platform: support-\nmasters@edx.org FALL 2023 DELETE DROP PERIOD We are currently in the Delete\nDrop Period for the FALL 2023 semester, and it will run through September 6th.\nA student may drop a course online through the fourth class day (August 24th).\nFrom the fifth class day through the 12th class day (August 25th \u2013 September\n6th), a student will need to complete the Delete Drop Form that our office\nwill provide in the next few days. Please understand that if you add or drop a\ncourse during this time period, our office needs 24 to 48 hours to update edX\nand WIO. If you intend to drop your only course, or all your courses, this is\nnot a Delete Drop - this is a withdrawal. Only a certain percentage of your\ntuition may be refunded. Information on how much will be refunded is available\nthrough this link and on the back of the form you will need to sign to\nwithdraw. Here is how to request withdrawal information: Email:\nMSDSGradCoordinator@utexas.edu Subject: MSDS \u2013 Fall 2023 - Withdrawal Request\n\u2013 YOUR EID Body of email: include a request for withdrawing from the semester.\nWhat to expect: A withdrawal form will be sent for you to complete.

INTERNATIONAL STUDENT INSURANCE WAIVER If you are an international\nstudent, there is a chance you may automatically be enrolled in student health\ninsurance based on your status. You have probably been receiving emails from\nthe International Office and if you have not already done this, it is vitally\nimportant for you to read this message from Texas Global to guide you: The\nUniversity of Texas Board of Regents requires all international students in a\nF-1, F-2, J-1, or J-2 visa status to have health insurance coverage which\ncomplies with the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n(PPACA). For this reason, enrollment in the UT Student Health Insurance Plan\nis automatic at the time of registration. This cost will be covered by the\ndepartment and then extended to the student in the middle of the semester.\nInternational students who are studying within the US and do not want this\ncoverage, may request a waiver as long as they can show proof of health\ninsurance coverage that meets the Board of Regents requirements. This means\nthe student must submit the waiver form and submit proof of the required\nhealth insurance coverage. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to request a\nwaiver before the 10th class day of each semester. It is good to note that if\nthe proof of insurance does not include medical evacuation and repatriation\ncoverages, then the student will automatically be enrolled in this. The\ndepartment will extend this cost to the student. Please be certain to complete\nthis waiver form as soon as possible. The deadline is Friday, September 1st,\n2023 at 5:00pm CT.

There is often little\nrecourse available if you reach out after the semester has ended. DSC 395T\nData Science for Health Discovery and Innovation will be taught in Canvas only\nand it will not have an edX page. CONFIRMING ATTENDANCE FOR SPRING 2024 Every\nstudent enrolled in the Spring 2024 semester needs to Confirm Attendance in\nthe My Tuition Bill webpage before January 19th. It is important to understand\nthat Confirming Attendance essentially confirms your commitment to attending\nthe Spring 2024 semester and paying for your course(s). If a student does not\nConfirm Attendance, they may be automatically dropped from their courses by UT\nsystem. If a student is dropped from their course(s) and wants to be added\nback, they would incur a late registration fee (anywhere from $50 to $200 -\namounts are dictated by the Registrar). You may confirm attendance on the My\nTuition Bill page. Note that our department is part of the College of Natural\nSciences, so do not be alarmed if you see Natural Sciences listed there.\nPlease note that if you have recently registered for courses, it may take at\nleast 24 hours for your What I Owe page, edX and My Tuition Bill page (student\nfees to be $0.00) to accurately reflect your registration.

Here is a list to guide you:\nAccounting Inquiries: CDSOadmin@austin.utexas.edu Program Inquiries:\nMSDSgradcoordinator@utexas.edu Class or content related issues: contact your\nclass TA (listed in syllabi) Technical issues with edX platform: support-\nmasters@edx.org SPRING 2024 DELETE DROP PERIOD We are currently in the Delete\nDrop Period for the Spring 2024 semester, and it will run through January\n31st.

Please understand that if you add or\ndrop a course during this time period, our office needs 24 to 48 hours to\nupdate edX and WIO. If you intend to drop your only course, or all your\ncourses, this is not a Delete Drop - this is a withdrawal. Only a certain\npercentage of your tuition may be refunded. Information on how much will be\nrefunded is available through this link and on the back of the form you will\nneed to sign to withdraw. Here is how to request withdrawal information:\nEmail: MSDSgradcoordinator@utexas.edu Subject: MSDS \u2013 Spring 2024 - Withdrawal\nRequest \u2013 (YOUR EID) Body of email: include a request for withdrawing from the\nsemester.

INTERNATIONAL STUDENT INSURCANCE WAIVER If you are an international\nstudent, there is a chance you may automatically be enrolled in student health\ninsurance based on your status. You have probably been receiving emails from\nthe International Office and if you have not already done this, it is vitally\nimportant for you to read this message from Texas Global to guide you: The\nUniversity of Texas Board of Regents requires all international students in a\nF-1, F-2, J-1, or J-2 visa status to have health insurance coverage which\ncomplies with the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n(PPACA). For this reason, enrollment in the UT Student Health Insurance Plan\nis automatic at the time of registration. This cost will be covered by the\ndepartment and then extended to the student in the middle of the semester.\nInternational students who are studying within the US and do not want this\ncoverage, may request a waiver as long as they can show proof of health\ninsurance coverage that meets the Board of Regents requirements. This means\nthe student must submit the waiver form and submit proof of the required\nhealth insurance coverage. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to request a\nwaiver before the 10th class day of each semester. It is good to note that if\nthe proof of insurance does not include medical evacuation and repatriation\ncoverages, then the student will automatically be enrolled in this. The\ndepartment will extend this cost to the student. Please be certain to complete\nthis waiver form as soon as possible. The deadline is Monday, January 29th,\n2024 at 5:00pm CT.
